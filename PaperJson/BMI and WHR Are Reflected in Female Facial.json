This allowed us to regress both shape and texture on BMI and W HR in order toes timate the facial features maximally associated with the two variables maximal co variance37 No variable reduction for

14 showedthat obese individuals BMI 30 have increased trans epidermal water loss skin blood flowand skin color red compared to sex and skin type matched controls with a lower BMIThey suggested that a higher sweat gland activity and superficial blood flow both being partof the temperature regulating system change the epidermal barrier and increase rednessmeasures In part the influence of BMI on skin color maybe mediated by blood pressuresince people with high BMI tend to have a higher systolic blood pressure than people withlow BMI 39 Another factor influencing skin coloration is diet Higher fruit and vegetablein takes are related to a yellower appearance of the skin 35 40 Women with higher BMIwere found to consume less fruits and vegetables 40 41 which in turn might result inlower skin yellow nessPerceived health is typically inferred from peri orbital lumi nance and cheek redness as wellas by global skin yellow ness 42 Both carotenoid and melanin coloration enhance perceivedattractiveness with a stronger preference for carotenoid in female faces 12 43 Fisher and colleagues 44 suggested that people use facial coloration to decide whether individuals withfacial shapes that indicate a low BMI are in good physical condition or ill and use this in formati on to judge attractivenessThe statistical prediction of BMI or W HR from facial shape and texture is challenged by thelarge number of variables which typically exceeds the number of cases As a result withinsample correlations overestimate the out of sample predictability Cross validation offers anapproach to derive more realistic estimates of prediction accuracy Using multiple linearregression and leave one out cross validation we were able to predict 25 27 of variation inBMI and 10 of variation in W HR by facial shape Facial texture predicted only about 3 ofvariation in BMI and W HRAn alternative approach also referred to as soft modeling or calibration 45 is the multivariate regression of shape texture on BMI instead of a multiple regression of BMI on shapetexture which requires no variable reduction and reduces over fitting The resulting re gression coefficients are the ones used for visualizing the shape or color pattern associated withBMI W HR while the partial coefficients resulting from a multiple regression can be more d iffi cult to interpret 37 46 47 In our sample the resulting scores BMI and W HR relatedshape scores allowed for a cross validated prediction of 26 and 10 of variation in BMI andW HR respectively which is as efficient as the conventional regression Facial texture scoresaccounted for only 10 of BMI variation and 3 of W HR variationUsing different regression methods based on cross validated sets of PCs Wolff heche let al15 were able to account for 23 of BMI variation by facial shape which is in the range of ourresults Strikingly they found that facial texture predicts 27 of variation in BMI while wecould predict only about 3 after cross validation This difference may result from the different regression methods and sample sizes but more likely it results from the differences inimage registration Most of the landmarks in our study as well as that in Wolff heche let al 15are semi landmarks that is they a replaced on homologous curves e g the facial outline buttheir positions along this curve are arbitrary We use the sliding landmark algorithm 23 24which slides the semi landmarks along their curves in order to minimize bending energy ameasure of local shape deformation 27 between the individuals landmarks and their sampleaverage This is the same quantity that is minimized by the TPS interpolation which we usedfor image warping 30 Perhaps this combined semi landmark alignment and image warpingis more efficient in removing shape information from the registered images than the linearwarping of Tid de manet al 29 and the raw landmarks used by Wolff heche land colleagues15 but this requires further investigation However combining shape and texture explainedonly 30 of BMI variation in Wolff heche let al 15 which indicates a high degree of red undancy of shape and texture variables and thus supports our explanation In our data by contra st the major components of shape and texture variation were only very weakly correlatedAccordingly combining the shape and texture scores increased the explained variance to 37for BMI and 25 for W HRIn our sample both BMI and W HR ratio were associated with the same patterns of facialshape and color despite the moderate correlation of BMI and W HR However in both st ati st ical approaches BMI was better predictable than W HR In other words the patterns ofassociation were the same for BMI and W HR but the magnitudes of association differedThis indicates that facial shape and color primarily reflects total body mass and fat prop ortion which is to a minor degree also captured by W HR but W HR is more influenced bythe distribution of fat across the bodyOur sample comprised only young adult middle European women Further studies arerequired to assess this relationship across a wide ethnic and age diversity Also it is unclear ifour results extend linearly to women with severe underweight or obesity because our samplecovered a BMI range from 17 to 35 only Despite the relatively small and homogeneous sample we were able to yield interpret able facial shape and color patterns that match those ofother studies Likewise the predictive power of shape and texture differed clearly for BMI andW HR However a larger sample might improve the results about the predictive value of facialtexture which was numerically relatively unstable in our analysis Similarly reliable insightsinto the association between facial shape and facial texture which was very weak in our sample may require a substantially larger sample##",
